# Python_Training_Exercise2

In today's session, we focused on learning about the building blocks of Python programming. We covered the basics of how to control the flow of a Python program. This includes understanding how to make decisions in code (if-else statements), and how to repeat actions with loops (for and while loops, try ...etc).
We also took a look at Python functions, which help us organize code into reusable pieces. We learned about setting default values for function arguments, how variables work inside functions, and how to create functions that can accept different numbers of arguments. We covered some extra topics like writing helpful descriptions for our functions, using recursion, and the special properties of Python functions.
Lastly, we learned about Python modules. These are like toolboxes that contain a bunch of functions we can use in our programs. We practiced how to make our own modules and how to use modules made by others.
